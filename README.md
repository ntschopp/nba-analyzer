# nba-analyzer
A program that scrapes all NBA team roster and player log data from basketball-reference by importing HTML tables via Pandas. Data is further organized into team and individual player rate stats by use of dictionaries and Pandas dataframes. This program's primary use is to compare players and teams in a given matchup by analyzing tendencies and potential body type mismatches.
